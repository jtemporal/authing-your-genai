# Auth-ing your GenAI: Implementing Auth and Tool Calling in a NextJS-based chat with Auth for GenAI

Welcome to the Oktane workshop, let's have fun and learn about tool calling.

Generative AI unlocks incredible potential, but how do you securely manage users and control the actions your AI takes, especially when calling external tools or APIs?

If you're a developer building GenAI applications and concerned about protecting user data and controlling AI actions, this 90-minute workshop is for you.

Weâ€™ll have a hands-on session implementing authentication and tool calling capabilities in a NextJS application. Come ready to code.

## The Workshop

Our assistant named Assistant0 is an AI personal assistant in the form of a chat. Assistant0 consolidates your digital life by dynamically accessing multiple tools to help you stay organized and efficient.

We are going to add two integrations via tool calling:

1. **Calculator**: So our assistant can learn how to do calculations; and
1. **Gmail Integration**: The assistant can scan your inbox to generate concise summaries. It can highlight urgent emails, categorizes conversations by importance, and even suggests drafts for quick replies.

## This Repository

The folder structure is as follows:

- `auth0-assistant0`: folder with the code we are going to update.

This project is meant to be used with [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces) and [CodeTour](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vsls-contrib.codetour).

## Where to begin

Start a [Codespace on `oktane` branch](https://github.com/codespaces/new?hide_repo_select=true&ref=oktane&repo=980255874).

Once the Codespaces finishes booting up you'll be able to select CodeTour on the left hand panel and start your workshop steps.

If you have questions feel free to ask those from the folks on the room. We will help you!
