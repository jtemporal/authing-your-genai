To add a calculator you'll need a LangChain community tool. Since this dependency is already installed you can import it."

If you check the terminal where the development server is running, you should see the tool calling data like below:\n\n```txt\nTool calls state: {\n \"call_E3Za9klJcJ5TADWiMj8XfjdB\": {\n   \"name\": \"calculator\",\n   \"args\": \"{\\n  \\\"input\\\": \\\"(2+56) * 200\\\"\\n}\"\n }\n}\nPOST /api/chat 200 in 8382ms\n```\n\nAnd you should see the answer in the chat window like so:\n\n![](images/02-1-assistant0-calculator-tool-call-answer.png)"
