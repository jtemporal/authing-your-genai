      "title": "What is tool calling",
      "description": "## What is tool calling\n\nTool calling is the way we call the integrations your GenAI-powered application has in order to gain some ability to interact with external services.\n\nFor example, a tool with Gmail and Google Calendar integration can help you speedily draft emails and schedule meetings.\n\nSo tools allow your AI agent to go beyond its pre-trained knowledge and interact with the real world, access private data securely, and perform actions on behalf of the user."

      "title": "The project",
      "description": "## Integrations we will implement during the workshop\n\nWe are going to add two integrations to the NextJS chat:\n\n1. **Calculator**: So our assistant can learn how to do calculations; and\n1. **Gmail Integration**: Assistant0 will be able to scan your inbox to generate concise summaries. It can highlight urgent emails, categorizes conversations by importance, and even suggests drafts for quick replies."
