      "description": "## Exercise\n\nIn case you want to have some fun, here's an idea for an email draft for you to send later.\n\nPrompt: \"Hey Assistant0, can you draft an email to my friend Will (william.johnson@okta.com) to tell them I just completed the 'Authing your GenAI' workshop? Mention that now I know how tool calling works and I'm very excited to add even more features securely with Auth0 in my GenAI applications.\"\n\nThe expected behavior:\n\n1. Recognize the intent to draft an email. Identify the recipient Jess and the email as well as the core message - to talk about the workshop.\n1. Then Use the gmailTool with an action like draft_email.\n1. Retrieve the Google access token using the Auth0 SDKs to draft the email\n1. Show the drafted email in chat and ask if there's anything else they could do."
